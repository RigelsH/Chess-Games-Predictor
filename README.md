# Predicting the outcomes of chess games

This project aims to predict the outcomes of chess games using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is taken from Kaggle.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:  
* pandas  
* numpy  
* matplotlib  
* seaborn  
* sklearn  
* scipy  

## Results

Several different machine learning models were tried and tested.Their performance was compared using cross-validation and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. Hyperparameters of the Decision Tree Classifier model were to improve its performance. The tuned Decission Tree Classifier model achieved an accuracy 93.7% on the test data from 92.4% before tuning. Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier both achieved ~96% accuracy.
